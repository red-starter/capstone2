## Description
Use machine learning techniques to explore crime in Chicago. Chicago a leading cities in homicides, having more than quadruple the amount of crimes than NYC. Can I get insight into what are the causes of crimes? What are the indicators of future crimes. One of the great thing about this project is that the data is constantly updated and well structured.

optional 
I can use other metadata from about the city from publicly available maps. Can I apply the findings to other cities?
